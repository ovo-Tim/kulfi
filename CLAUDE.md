# Claude Collaboration Guidelines

## Writing Style

### Humble and Factual Language
- **Avoid superlatives**: No "revolutionary", "game-changing", "groundbreaking"
- **Avoid hyperbole**: No "amazing", "incredible", "phenomenal" 
- **Be factual**: Focus on what the software actually does
- **Be modest**: Let users judge the value, don't oversell
- **Use specific benefits**: "20% faster" instead of "incredibly fast"

### Examples:

**Instead of:**
- "Revolutionary SSH replacement"
- "Groundbreaking security model"  
- "Amazing user experience"
- "Incredible multi-cluster capabilities"

**Use:**
- "SSH alternative with P2P networking"
- "Security model based on cryptographic verification"
- "Streamlined command syntax"
- "Multi-cluster support"

### Technical Writing
- **Clear and precise**: Technical accuracy over marketing language
- **User-focused**: What problem does this solve for users?
- **Implementation-focused**: How does it actually work?
- **Honest about limitations**: What doesn't work yet?

### Code Comments and Documentation
- **Explain the why**: Not just what the code does, but why
- **Factual descriptions**: Avoid subjective quality judgments
- **Focus on use cases**: When would someone use this?
- **Be helpful**: Guide users to success

This approach builds trust through honest, helpful communication rather than marketing hype.
